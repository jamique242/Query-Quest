<h2>📜 Welcome to Query Quest</h2>

Every data journey starts somewhere.

For me, the journey began in Power BI, where I learned that queries and reports are useless without reliable data. That lesson ignited my interest, and as I ventured deeper into operational and analytical realms, I descended into the abyss of data engineering — forging dependable models, crafting scalable pipelines, and shaping messy, real-world signals into actionable insight.

<b>Query Quest</b> is my structured learning and experimentation repository built to sharpen those skills with intention, through project-based learning.

<h1>🍺 The Data Tavern Philosophy</h1>

Inside my development environment known as the Data Tavern, each project in this repository represents an “adventure” — a progressive challenge designed to simulate real-world data engineering and analytics engineering scenarios.

Just as adventurers leave a tavern to explore new territories, each dataset introduces a new landscape requiring exploration, modeling strategy, and technical craftsmanship.
This repository serves as not only a professional portfolio & engineering training ground, but its also a knowledge archive: documenting lessons learned and technical growth.

<h2>🏹 Adventure Structure</h2>
Projects are organized as progressive learning paths:

* Adventure.01 – SQL Foundations & Data Modeling
* Adventure.02 – Time Series & Transportation Analytics
* Adventure.03 – Event & Behavioral Data Engineering
* Adventure.04+ – Advanced Analytics, Feature Engineering, and ML Preparation

Each adventure emphasizes:
* Grain identification and schema design
* Data cleaning and transformation pipelines
* Window functions and temporal reasoning
* Data quality validation
* Scalability and performance thinking
* Clear documentation and storytelling


<h1>⚙️ Technical Focus Areas</h1>

This repository emphasizes practical, production-style data engineering concepts including:
* Analytical SQL and transformation pipeline design
* Dimensional data modeling (facts, dimensions, and grain definition)
* Time-series and behavioral event data processing
* Data quality validation and testing strategies
* Performance-aware query optimization
* Feature engineering preparation for machine learning workflows

<h2> ⚔️ Technology Stack</h2>

This work leverages tools commonly used across modern data platforms:
* MotherDuck / DuckDB
* SQL (Analytics Engineering Focus)
* Python & PySpark (future integration and experimentation)
* Parquet Data Storage
* Git & Version Controlled Development
* Markdown Documentation

<h1>🛡️ Why This Matters</h1>

In enterprise analytics roles, I’ve seen firsthand how data modeling and transformation design directly impact business decisions, reporting accuracy, and system performance. Query Quest exists to deepen those foundational engineering capabilities while building a portfolio that reflects real-world data problem solving.

<h3>📈 Career Growth Direction</h3>
